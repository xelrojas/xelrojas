# ​👩🏻‍💻💜 Hi, I'm Xelic!

![Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea5b000c-52b8-4761-9c23-51425390c209)



I’m an **Industrial Engineer specialized in Total Quality**, currently working as a **Functional Consultant at an Odoo Partner company**.  
I focus on **ERP systems, functional analysis, and quality assurance**, acting as a bridge between business needs and technical teams.

My work combines **consulting, functional QA, and Agile project collaboration**, covering the full lifecycle: from requirement analysis and user stories to testing, validation, and successful delivery. 🚀

I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood, collaborating with developers, and ensuring solutions are **functional, stable, and aligned with real business processes**.
